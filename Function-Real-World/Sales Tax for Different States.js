In e-commerce, sales tax can vary depending on the state or region where the customer is located. The system needs to calculate the correct sales tax based on the customerâ€™s shipping address.

Function: calculateSalesTax
This function takes the price of items and the tax rate (which varies by state) and calculates the total tax amount.
Imagination:
The calculateSalesTax function acts like a tax consultant for your e-commerce business. It helps ensure that you are charging the correct amount of sales tax based on where the customer is located.
If a customer is buying a product for $300, and the sales tax in their state is 7%:

function calculateSalesTax(price, taxRate) {
    return price * taxRate;
}
let salesTax = calculateSalesTax(300, 0.07);
console.log(`Sales Tax: $${salesTax.toFixed(2)}`);
// Output: Sales Tax: $21.00
